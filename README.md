# How To Ask A Question

## Before Asking
- Narrow down the problem to get a as clear as possible idea of where things go wrong
- Try to solve the problem yourself
- Use Google
- Remove unnecessary aspects from the context in which the problem occurs to narrow the scope and recuse the number of variables that might cause of contribute to the problem
